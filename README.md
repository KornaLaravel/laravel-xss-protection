Laravel Middleware to protect your app against Cross-site scripting (XSS). It sanitizes request input by utilising the [Laravel Security](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Security) package, and it can sanatize [Blade echo statements](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#displaying-data) as well.

## Launcher ðŸš€

Hey! We've built a Docker-based deployment tool to launch apps and sites fully containerized. You can find all features and the roadmap on our [website](https://uselauncher.com), and we are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uselauncher) as well!

## Support

We proudly support the community by developing Laravel packages and giving them away for free. Keeping track of issues and pull requests takes time, but we're happy to help! If this package saves you time or if you're relying on it professionally, please consider [supporting the maintenance and development](https://github.com/sponsors/pascalbaljet).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-xss-protection
```

You may publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-xss-protection-config"
```

## Middleware Usage

You may use the `ProtoneMedia\LaravelXssProtection\Middleware\XssCleanInput` middleware in the route that handles the form submission.

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\CreateAccountController;
use ProtoneMedia\LaravelXssProtection\Middleware\XssCleanInput;

Route::post('account', CreateAccountController::class)->middleware(XssCleanInput::class);
```

If your app has a lot of forms handled by many different controllers, you could opt to register it as global middleware.

```php
// inside app\Http\Kernel.php

protected $middleware = [
   // ...
   \ProtoneMedia\LaravelXssProtection\Middleware\XssCleanInput::class,
];
```

## Configuration

### File uploads

By default, the middleware allows file uploads. However, you may disallow file uploads by changing the `middleware.allow_file_uploads` configuration key to `false`.

### Blade echo statements

By default, the middleware sanatizes [Blade echo statements](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/blade#displaying-data) like `{{ $name }}`, `{{{ $name }}}`, and `{!! $name !!}`. You may allow echo statements by changing the `middleware.allow_blade_echoes` configuration key to `true`.

### Completely replace malicious input

By default, the middleware transforms malicious input to `null`. You may configure the middleware to only transform the malicious part by setting the `middleware.completely_replace_malicious_input` configuration key to `false`. That way, an input string like `hey <script>alert('laravel')</script>` will be transformed to `hey` instead of `null`.

### Terminate request

Instead of transforming malicious input, you may configure the middleware to terminate the request whenever anything malicious has been found. You may do this by setting the `middleware.terminate_request_on_malicious_input` to `true`, which will throw an HttpException with status code 403.
